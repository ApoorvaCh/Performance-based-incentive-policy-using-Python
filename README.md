# Performance based incentive policy using Python
This project provides the incentives to the faculty based on their performance. This includes all core areas of the technical institutional objectives like Academic Result, Academic Feedback, Research &amp; Development and other contributions.
This project was developed using Python.

This Geometric Hybrid Model for Performance Based Incentive(GHMPBI) policy provides fair and accurate evaluation both objectively and subjectively. It creates competition among professors in terms of their results, research output correspondingly which uplifts the institute goals. In this GHMPBI policy, higher performer always encourages with higher incentive. A range of perverse outcomes occur because of faculty ‘game playing’ to impress the superior rather than his or her core values. Whereas in case of GHMPBI policy fully automated which creates better opportunities to prove individual by creating competition among them.
